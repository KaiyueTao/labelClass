It's a very beginning version, developed with PyQt5, make sure it's installed and then:

```
Python3 labelClass.py
```

It's for the convenience in labeling multi-classes image dataset. The labeled info will be saved in a **json** file with a Python dictionary data structure. Other format like **txt** and **xml** will be added soon.
